# 1. Overview {#Overview}


This analysis is carried out to support RSVP Movies with a well-analyzed list of global stars to plan a movie for the global audience in 2022.

With this, we will be able to answer a set of analytical questions to suggest RSVP Production House on which set of actors, directors, and production houses would be the best fit for a super hit commercial movie.

### About RSVP
RSVP Movies is an Indian film production company that has produced many super-hit movies. They have usually released movies for the Indian audience but for their next project, they are planning to release a movie for the global audience in 2022.

### Why this Analysis?
The production company wants to plan its every move analytically based on data and has approached for help with this new project.

We have been provided with the data of the movies that have been released in the past three years.
Let's analyze the data set and draw meaningful insights that can help them start their new project. 

 
### Tool Stack
We will use SQL to analyze the given data and give recommendations to RSVP Movies based on the insights.

We will be carrying out the entire analytics process into four segments, where each segment leads to significant insights from different combinations of tables.

# 2. Database Creation for the Project {#Database-Creation}


### a. Check the List of Database

* The very first step of any MySQL analysis is to access the database and check if related data is available or not.
* Use `show databases;` to access the list of databases:

| Database      |
| -----------      |
| classicmodels      |
| company      |
| information_schema      |
| market_star_schema      |
| org      |


### b. Create Database
* Create a new database for this project.
* Use `Create database IMDB;`
* Use `show databases;` to confirm the list of databases:

| Database      |
| -----------      |
| classicmodels      |
| company      |
| imdb      |
| information_schema      |
| market_star_schema      |
| org      |

### c. Use Database
* Instruct the system to use `*IMDB Database*` by running `use imdb;`


***
***

# 3. Table Creation {#Table-Creation}


#### Steps to follow before creating the table:

* Download the IMDb dataset. And try to understanding every table and its importance.
* Understand the ERD and the table details. Study them carefully and understand the relationships between the table.

							
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73750698/166613322-f9ede9ac-15ce-4f59-98b4-4d50f3831db1.png)

	
* Inspect each table given in the subsequent tabs and understand the features associated with each of them.
* Draft your table with the correct Data Type and Constraints in a paper or note file.
* Open your MySQL Workbench and start writing the DDL and DML commands to create the database.

# 4. Data Insertion {#Data-Insertion}


In the previous steps, we created six tables. Now, we will insert the data into these tables.
Here, we will be showing the syntax of 5 rows insertion into each table. (The complete data insertion syntax is available in the Repository)

### a. Inserting data into Movie Table

```
INSERT INTO movie VALUES
('tt0012494','Der m√ºde Tod',2017,'2017-06-09',97,'Germany','$ 12156','German','Decla-Bioscop AG'),
('tt0038733','A Matter of Life and Death',2017,'2017-12-08',104,'UK','$ 124241','English, French, Russian','The Archers'),
('tt0361953','The Nest of the Cuckoo Birds',2017,'2017-10-16',81,'USA',null,'English','Bert Williams Motion Pictures and Distributor'),
('tt0235166','Against All Hope',2017,'2017-10-20',90,'USA',null,'English',null),
('tt0337383','Vaikai is Amerikos viesbucio',2017,'2017-03-09',88,'Soviet Union',null,'Lithuanian, Russian','Lietuvos Kinostudija');
```
***

### b. Inserting data into Genre Table

```
INSERT INTO genre VALUES
('tt0012494','Thriller'),
('tt0012494','Fantasy'),
('tt0012494','Drama'),
('tt0038733','Fantasy'),
('tt0038733','Drama');

```
***


### c. Inserting data into Director_Mapping Table

```
INSERT INTO director_mapping VALUES
('tt0038733','nm0003836'),
('tt0038733','nm0696247'),
('tt0060908','nm0003606'),
('tt0069049','nm0000080'),
('tt0082620','nm0716460');

```
***


### d. Inserting data into Role_Mapping Table

```
INSERT INTO role_mapping VALUES
('tt0038733','nm0000057','actor'),
('tt0038733','nm0001375','actress'),
('tt0038733','nm0178509','actor'),
('tt0038733','nm0126402','actress'),
('tt0060908','nm0000869','actor');

```
***



### e. Inserting data into Names Table

```
INSERT INTO names VALUES
('nm0000002','Lauren Bacall','174','1924-09-16',null),
('nm0000110','Kenneth Branagh','177','1960-12-10','tt3402236'),
('nm0000009','Richard Burton','175','1925-11-10',null),
('nm0000114','Steve Buscemi','175','1957-12-13','tt4686844'),
('nm0000014','Olivia de Havilland','163','1916-07-01',null);

```
***


### f. Inserting data into Ratings Table

```
INSERT INTO ratings VALUES
('tt0012494',7.7,4695,8),
('tt0038733',8.1,17693,8),
('tt0060908',7.5,3392,8),
('tt0069049',6.9,5014,7),
('tt0071145',8.2,789,8);

```
***


### Checking tables for inserted Values:

`Select * from Movie;`


`Select * from Genre; `


`Select * from Director_Mapping;`


`Select * from Role_Mapping;`


`Select * from Names;`


`Select * from Ratings;`

All the sample data inserted looks good. SO, we can go ahead with insertion of complete data. 
For insertion to work smoothly, lets drop all data from tables using `TRUNCATE` : 

```
TRUNCATE Movie;
TRUNCATE  Genre;
TRUNCATE  Director_Mapping;
TRUNCATE Role_Mapping;
TRUNCATE Names;
TRUNCATE Ratings;
```

## 19. Who are the top three directors in the top three genres whose movies have an average rating > 8?

### Approach:

#### Step 1:

Pull the Top three Genre by Movie count where avg_rating > 8

```
	SELECT genre, count(g.movie_id) as movie_counts
	FROM genre as g
		INNER JOIN ratings as r 
			ON r.movie_id=g.movie_id
	WHERE avg_rating>8
	GROUP BY genre
	ORDER BY count(g.movie_id) DESC
	LIMIT 3;
```

#### Step 2:

Pull the Directors with Movie count where avg_rating > 8

```
	SELECT n.name as director_name, 
		count(g.movie_id) as movie_count
	FROM names n
	INNER JOIN director_mapping as d
		ON n.id=d.name_id
	INNER JOIN genre as g
		ON d.movie_id=g.movie_id
	INNER JOIN ratings as r
		ON r.movie_id=g.movie_id
		
	-- top_3_genres
	WHERE 
	-- g.genre IN (top_3_genres.genre) AND 
	avg_rating> 8           
	GROUP BY director_name
	ORDER BY movie_count DESC;

```


#### Step 3:

Keeping "top_3_genres" as CTE, restrict the 2nd code to avg_rating > 8 and directors of top_3_genre

```
WITH top_3_genres aS 
	(
		SELECT genre, count(g.movie_id) as movie_counts
		FROM genre as g
			INNER JOIN ratings as r 
				ON r.movie_id=g.movie_id
		WHERE avg_rating > 8
		GROUP BY genre
		ORDER BY count(g.movie_id) DESC
		LIMIT 3
	)    
SELECT n.name as director_name, count(g.movie_id) as movie_count
FROM names n
	INNER JOIN director_mapping as d
		ON n.id=d.name_id
	INNER JOIN genre as g
		ON d.movie_id=g.movie_id
	INNER JOIN ratings as r
		ON r.movie_id=g.movie_id, top_3_genres
WHERE 
	g.genre IN (top_3_genres.genre)
	AND avg_rating> 8           
GROUP BY director_name
ORDER BY movie_count DESC
limit 3;
```

## Trying Row_Number() function:

```
Select * from names;

select
		G.Genre,
		N.NAME as director,
		count(distinct G.Movie_ID) as "Movie Count",
		row_number() over (partition by G.Genre order by count(distinct G.Movie_ID) desc) as "Row Number"

FROM
	Genre as G
	Inner Join Movie as M
	on 	G.movie_id = M.ID

	inner Join director_mapping as D
    ON D.Movie_ID = M.ID
    
    Inner Join Names as N
    ON N.ID = D.Name_ID
    
    Inner Join Ratings as R
    ON R.Movie_ID = M.ID
    
    where avg_rating > 8
    
    group by n.name, genre
    order by count(distinct G.Movie_ID) desc
    ;
    
```

## 20. Who are the top two actors whose movies have a median rating >= 8?


```
SELECT n.name as actor_name, count(r.movie_id) as movie_count
FROM role_mapping as rm
INNER JOIN names as n
	ON rm.name_id=n.id
INNER JOIN ratings as r
	ON rm.movie_id=r.movie_id
WHERE r.median_rating>=8 AND rm.category LIKE 'actor'
GROUP BY name
ORDER BY movie_count DESC
Limit 2;
```

## 21. Which are the top three production houses based on the number of votes received by their movies?

```
SELECT production_company, total_votes as vote_count

GROUP BY production_company
order by vote_count desc
LIMIT 3;

## 22. Rank actors with movies released in India based on their average ratings. Which actor is at the top of the list?
-- Note: The actor should have acted in at least five Indian movies. 

### ALTERNTIVE 1 (Using Rank Window Function):
```
        SELECT
		n.name as actor_name,
		sum( total_votes) as total_votes, 
		count(r.movie_id) as movie_count, 	
		round(sum(avg_rating*total_votes)/sum(total_votes),2) as actor_avg_rating,
                row_number() over(order by round(sum(avg_rating*total_votes)/sum(total_votes),2) desc, count(r.movie_id) desc)

	FROM movie as  m
	INNER JOIN ratings as r 
		ON m.id=r.movie_id
	INNER JOIN role_mapping as rm 
		ON m.id=rm.movie_id
	INNER JOIN names as n
		ON rm.name_id=n.id

	WHERE country LIKE 'India' AND category ='actor'

	GROUP BY name

        HAVING movie_count > 4
;

```


#### ALTERNATIVE 2 (Using CTE):

```
With Top_Actors as (
	SELECT
			n.name as actor_name,
			sum( total_votes) as total_votes, 
			count(r.movie_id) as movie_count, 	
			round(sum(avg_rating*total_votes)/sum(total_votes),2) as actor_avg_rating
	FROM movie as  m
	INNER JOIN ratings as r 
		ON m.id=r.movie_id
	INNER JOIN role_mapping as rm 
		ON m.id=rm.movie_id
	INNER JOIN names as n
		ON rm.name_id=n.id
	WHERE country LIKE 'India' AND category ='actor'
	GROUP BY name
    HAVING movie_count > 4
    )
Select *,
    row_number() over( order by actor_avg_rating desc, movie_count desc)
FROM Top_Actors
;

```

## 23.Find out the top five actresses in Hindi movies released in India based on their average ratings? 
-- Note: The actresses should have acted in at least three Indian movies. 

```
WITH hindi_actress_rank as

	GROUP BY name
	)
SELECT * , 	
	RANK () OVER (ORDER BY actress_avg_rating DESC,total_votes DESC) AS actress_rank
FROM hindi_actress_rank
WHERE movie_count>=3;
